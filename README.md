# Team 18650 SDK - POWERPLAY Redux (2022-2023) [ARCHIVED]

> **This repository is archived.** It contains historical code from the POWERPLAY competition season for reference only.

This was Team 18650's **mid-season restart** for POWERPLAY. The team started fresh here after the robot design evolved to include arm mechanisms.

## Why "Redux"?

The original [18650-sdk-powerplay](https://github.com/bennington-area-robotics/18650-sdk-powerplay) repo focused on signal detection. This redux version was a fresh start to:
- Use a newer SDK version with bug fixes
- Build cleaner code for the arm and collector mechanisms
- Improve autonomous and driver control

## What This Code Did

- Arm control with preset positions
- Collector tilt mechanism
- Improved navigation and autonomous modes
- Refined driver controls

## Code Highlights

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `armStuff.java`, `Armstuff2.java` | Arm motor control and presets |
| `DriveMode.java` | TeleOp driver controls |
| `AutonomousMode.java` | Autonomous routines |
| `Navtest*.java` | Navigation and positioning experiments |
